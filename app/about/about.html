        <h2>Welcome to MovieMash a game sample inspired from Facemash</h2>
        
        <p>This project is aimed to emphasize the ability of Firebase to be used by AngularJs in order to provide a real time experience. Inspired from Mark Zuckerberg's Facemash application, the game here is pretty simple and kind of similar. The best movies are gathered from IMDB, and you have to select during a contest what movie you did prefer between two movies.</p>
