# MovieMash
A movie game sample with AngularJs and Firebase


### Prerequisites

I have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:
```
npm install
```
### Launch the App

Simply run 

```
npm start
```
and the application will run and be hosted on a local server on port 8000
